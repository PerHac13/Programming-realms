# Observer Design Pattern

```
 the Observer Pattern allows one object (the subject) to notify other objects (the observers) whenever there is a change in its state. This is great for systems where certain parts of your application need to stay updated in real-time but shouldnâ€™t be tightly coupled to each other.
```

### Problem Statement

- **Channel**: is the subject that notifies its subscribers (observers) about new content.
- **Subscriber**: is the observer that gets notified when new content is available.

### Problem without Observer Design Pattern
