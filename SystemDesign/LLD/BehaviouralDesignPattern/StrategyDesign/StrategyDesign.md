# Strategy Design Pattern

```
 the Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms or behaviors, and choose the one to use during runtime. It is like having a toolbox where you can pick the best tool (or strategy) for the task at hand. This approach avoids hardcoding multiple behaviors into one class and promotes flexibility by separating the behavior logic into different classes.
