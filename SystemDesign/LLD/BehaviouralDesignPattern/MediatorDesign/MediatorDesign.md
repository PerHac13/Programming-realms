# Mediator Design Pattern

The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to communicate with each other without needing to know about each other's internal details. It promotes loose coupling by introducing a mediator object that handles the communication between different components. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects need to interact, but you want to avoid direct dependencies between them.

```
The Mediator Design Pattern is like having an organized auction house that manages all the communication between bidders. It prevents the chaos of direct communication and makes the system more flexible and maintainable. By centralizing interactions, you keep your code clean, decoupled, and ready for future extensions—be it adding logging, timers, or more features!
