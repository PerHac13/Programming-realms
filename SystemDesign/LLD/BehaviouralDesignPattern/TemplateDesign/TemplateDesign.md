# Template Design Pattern

```
The Template Design Pattern is like that secret recipe. you always keep in your notebook. It provides a reliable blueprint for algorithms, ensuring consistency while still allowing for flexibility. By using this pattern, you can write cleaner, more maintainable code and impress those interviewers with your deep understanding of design principles!
```

Template Design Pattern because it provides a fixed “template” for an algorithm. The steps are defined in a base class, but the details (like brewing coffee vs. steeping tea) are left for the subclasses. This ensures that the overall process remains consistent while allowing flexibility for variations—just like following a cookie recipe and swapping out ingredients!
