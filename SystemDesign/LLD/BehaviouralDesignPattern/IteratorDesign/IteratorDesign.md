# Iterator Design Pattern

```
The Iterator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows us to traverse a collection of objects (like arrays or lists) without exposing the underlying implementation details. Think of it as a tour guide showing you around a museum: instead of telling you how the exhibits are arranged, the guide simply takes you through the rooms one by one, in an easy-to-follow order.
```

### Implementation of Iterator Design Pattern:

- Iterator Interface
- Concrete Iterator Class
  - Simple Playlist Iterator
  - Shuffled Playlist Iterator
  - Favorite Playlist Iterator
- Playlist Interface
- Concrete Playlist Class

### Pros and Cons:

- [+] Flexible traversal of collections
- [+] Seperation of concerns
- [+] Scalablility

### Real-World Example:

- DB Records
- Game Object Iteration
