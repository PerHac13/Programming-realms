# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same.

## Structural Design Patterns:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Why?

- Organized Code
- Reduced Dependencies
- Reusablity
- Simplified Maintenance
