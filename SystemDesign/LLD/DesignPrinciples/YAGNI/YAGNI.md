# YAGNI Principle

YAGNI is a principle in software development that suggests developers should only implement features that are necessary for the current requirements and not add any additional functionality that might be needed in the future. This principle is based on the idea that adding unnecessary features can lead to increased complexity, longer development times, and potentially more bugs.

The YAGNI principle is closely related to the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid), which advocates for simplicity in design and avoiding unnecessary complexity. Both principles encourage developers to focus on delivering the simplest solution that meets current requirements, rather than trying to anticipate and accommodate potential future needs.

### Key Features of YAGNI:

- **Prevents Over-Engineering**
- **Saves Time and Resources**
- **Improves Code Maintainability**
- **Aligns with Agile Methodologies**

### How to Implement the YAGNI Principle:

- Get the necessary requirements
- Discuss with your team
- Analyze a simple plan for the solution
- Refuse if it does not meet the current requirements
- Have a record of your progress

### Pros and Cons of YAGNI:

- [+] Faster Development
- [+] Simplicity
- [+] Cost Saving
- [+] User Focus
- [-] Incomplete or inefficient solutions
- [-] Difficulty in Estimation
- [-] Increased Complexity in Refactoring
- [-] Team Coordination Challenges
