# DRY Principle

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a software development principle that encourages developers to avoid duplicating code in a system. The main idea behind DRY is to reduce redundancy and promote efficiency by ensuring that a particular piece of knowledge or logic exists in only one place within a codebase.

### Key Features of DRY:

- **Code Reusability**
- **Maintainance and Updates**
- **Readability**
- **Consistency**
- **Reduced Development Time**
- **Facilitates Collaboration**
- **Avoidance of Copy-Paste Programming**
- **Improved Testing**

### How to implement the DRY Principle:

- **Use Functions and Methods**
- **Create Libraries and Modules**
- **Utilize Inheritance and Polymorphism**

### Pros and Cons of DRY:

- [+] Efficiency
- [+] Maintainability
- [+] Scalability
- [+] Consistency
- [+] Collaboration
- [-] Over-Abstraction Risks
- [-] Initial Time Investment
