# Prototype Design Pattern

```
The Prototype Design Pattern is a powerful and efficient way to create new objects by cloning existing prototypes and making small modifications. This pattern eliminates the need for repetitive code, makes maintenance easier, and improves the flexibility of your code. Whether you're building game characters, generating documents, or creating configuration settings, the Prototype Pattern can make object creation faster, cleaner, and more efficient.
```

Prototype Design Pattern is used to create new objects by cloning existing objects (prototypes) instead of instantiating them from scratch. It is ideal when object creation is costly or repetitive.

## Key Points:

- Avoids costly new operations by using clone().
- Useful for creating many similar objects with small differences.
- Promotes flexibility and reduces code duplication.

### Benefits:

- Faster object creation.
- Cleaner and reusable code.
- Easy to maintain and extend.

### Example Use Cases:

- Game characters with base stats.
- Document or UI templates.
- Configuration objects.
