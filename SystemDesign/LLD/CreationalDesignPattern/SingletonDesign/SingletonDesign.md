# Singleton Design Pattern

```
The Singleton Design Pattern is a powerful way to ensure that a class has only one instance throughout the application. By using a private constructor and a static method to access the instance, the Singleton pattern simplifies resource management, particularly for things like logging, database connections, and configuration management.
In a multithreaded environment, we can make the Singleton thread-safe by using Double-Checked Locking and the volatile keyword, ensuring that only one instance is created even when multiple threads are involved.

The Singleton Pattern is widely used in many real-world applications because of its ability to provide consistent access to a single resource, helping to reduce memory usage and increase efficiency

### Problem with Traditional Approach

- Multiple Instances of Logger
- Inconsistent Logging
- Difficulty Managing State

#### Double Checked Loacking

- Only one instance of the Logger is created, even in a multithreaded environment.
- Threads donâ€™t block each other unnecessarily after the instance is created, which keeps the application efficient.
- The use of volatile ensures that changes to the instance are visible across all threads.

### Example

- Logging system
- Database connections
- Configuration Settings
- Thread Polling
