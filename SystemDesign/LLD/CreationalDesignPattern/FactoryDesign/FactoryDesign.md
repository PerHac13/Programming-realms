# Factory Design Pattern

Creating Objects Dynamically (different type of object creation)

```
 The Factory Design Pattern simplifies object creation by centralizing it in a factory, making the code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to extend. It ensures that we can easily add new types or change the instantiation logic without touching the client code. This pattern is highly beneficial when your application needs to create a variety of objects in a flexible and scalable way.
```

The Factory Pattern will allow us to handle the object creation in a centralized manner, so that we don't need to keep repeating the logic of choosing which vehicle to create in multiple places.
The Factory Design Pattern is named after a "factory" because, just like a factory produces different types of products, the pattern provides a central place (the factory) to create objects of different types. üè≠ Instead of directly instantiating objects, the factory method is responsible for producing the correct object, making the system more flexible and organized.

### Pro:

- [+] **Centralized Object Creation**
- [+] **Scalability**
- [+] **Encapsulation**
