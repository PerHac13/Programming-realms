# SOLID Principles

Software development is a complex field that requires careful planning and design to ensure that applications are maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand. One of the foundational guidelines for achieving these goals is the set of SOLID principles. 🛠️📊

SOLID principles are five essential guidelines that enhance software design, making code more maintainable and scalable. They include:

1. Single Responsibility Principle 🔑

2. Open/Closed Principle 🔓

3. Liskov Substitution Principle 🔄

4. Interface Segregation Principle 📏

5. Dependency Inversion Principle 🔗

### Need for SOLID Principles

- **_Scalability_**: Adding new features becomes straightforward without affecting existing code.
- **_Maintainability_**: Changes in one part of the system have minimal impact on others.
- **_Testability_**: Decoupling components makes unit testing easier.
- **_Readability_**: Clear separation of concerns leads to better understanding.

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 🔑

This principle states that A class should have only one reason to change which means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose. In other words, a class should have only one job or purpose within the software system.

### Why SRP is Important?

- **_Improved maintainability_**: Changes to one responsibility do not affect others.
- Enhances readabilty and reduces complexity.
- Things are modular and easier to understand.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) 🔓

This principle states that Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be **open for extension, but closed for modification** which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.

### Why OCP is Important?

- Prevent breaking existing code
- Encourages reusable components

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 🔄

The principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 and according to this principle Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes. This principle ensures that **any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior**.

### Why LSP is Important?

- Ensures reliability when using polymorphism.
- Avoid unexpected behavior in subclass implementations.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 📏

This principle is the first principle that applies to Interfaces instead of classes in SOLID and it is similar to the Single Responsibility principle. It states that**_ do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them_**.
Here your main goal is to focus on avoiding fat interface and give preference to many small client-specific interfaces. You should prefer many client interfaces rather than one general interface and each interface should have a specific responsibility.

### Why ISP is Important?

- Reduces unnecessary dependencies.
- Simplifies implementation for specific use cases.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 🔗

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a principle in object-oriented design that states that High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

In simpler terms, the DIP suggests that **_classes should rely on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations_**. This allows for more flexible and decoupled code, making it easier to change implementations without affecting other parts of the codebase.

#### Why DIP is Important?

- Promotes decoupled architecture.
- Enhances maintainability and testability.
